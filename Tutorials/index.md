# Tutorials about seL4

We have developed a series of tutorials to introduce seL4 and
developing systems on seL4.

<h2>Categories</h2>
The tutorials are split into a number of broad categories:

- [About seL4](GettingStarted/about-seL4) and [Getting started with the Microkit tutorial](GettingStarted/microkit) introduce seL4 concepts.
- The [seL4 Kernel tutorials](seL4Kernel/overview.md) are a deep dive into seL4 concepts.
- [MCS](MCS/mcs-extensions) introduces seL4 MCS extensions.
- [Dynamic Libraries](DynamicLibraries/initialisation.md) covers the libraries that have been developed for rapidly prototyping systems on seL4.
- [CAmkES](CAmkES/hello-camkes.md) is a platform for building componentised systems for embedded platforms.
- [Microkit](https://trustworthy.systems/projects/microkit/tutorial/)is an operating system framework on top of seL4 provides a small set of simple abstractions that ease the design and implementation of statically structured systems on seL4. (Links to the same tutorial as in the [Getting Started](GettingStarted/microkit) section.)
- [Rust](https://github.com/seL4/rust-sel4) provide crates for supporting the use of Rust in seL4 userspace.

<h2>Resources</h2>
Additional resources to assist with learning:
- The [seL4 manual](https://sel4.systems/Info/Docs/seL4-manual-latest.pdf)
- [API references](projects/sel4/api-doc)
- The [How to](Resources/how-to) page provides links to tutorial solutions as quick references for seL4 calls and methods.
- [FAQs](projects/sel4/frequently-asked-questions)
- [Debugging guide](projects/sel4-tutorials/debugging-guide)
- [Discourse forum](https://sel4.discourse.group/)
- [Developer mailing list](https://lists.sel4.systems/postorius/lists/devel.sel4.systems/)
- [Mattermost channel](https://mattermost.trustworthy.systems/sel4-external/channels/web-doc-revamp)
