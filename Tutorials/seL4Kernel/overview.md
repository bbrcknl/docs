<h1>Overview</h1>
We have developed a series of tutorials to on seL4 concepts. These assume a basic understanding of seL4, e.g. by having done the <a href="../GettingStarted/microkit">Microkit tutorial</a>.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
Note that all of these tutorials require C programming
experience and some understanding of operating systems and computer
architecture.  Suggested resources for these include:

- C programming language
	- [C tutorial](https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c-tutorial.html)
- Operating Systems:
	- [Modern Operating Systems (book)](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Operating-Systems-Andrew-Tanenbaum/dp/013359162X)
	- [COMP3231 at UNSW](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs3231)
- Computer Architecture
	- [Computer Architecture (wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture)
	- [Instruction Set Architecture (wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture)

<h2>Resources</h2>
We recommend having access to the <a href="https://sel4.systems/Info/Docs/seL4-manual-latest.pdf">seL4 manual<a/> and the <a href="../../projects/sel4/api-doc.html">API references</a>.

The <a href="../Resources/how-to">How to</a> page provides links to tutorial solutions as quick references for seL4 calls and methods.
