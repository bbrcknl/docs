<h1>The seL4 Microkit</h1>
<p>
    The seL4 Microkit is an operating system framework on top of seL4 provides a small set of simple abstractions that ease the design and implementation of statically structured systems on seL4, while still leveraging the kernelâ€™s benefits of security and performance.
</p>
<p>
    The Microkit is distributed as an SDK that integrates with the build system of your choice, significantly reducing the barrier to entry for new users of seL4.
